1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:07,580
In the last video, we generated a geometry cache of the skin using our simulation results.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,180
Next, K underscore email for our muscles, which is dash.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,340
Now, let's go to preview scene.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,640
For a detailed explanation of the parameters, you can review the muscle simulation video

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
to make sure you have the animal deformer.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,260
Right now, we'll just quickly go through the parameters here.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,460
For this example, you have to use 20 sub-steps and also animal deformer neuromorph model iterations.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,840
If you just have them checked, you should restart editing more layers than just the muscles.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,580
It contains the fat layer, which relies on the movement of the muscles and the multiformer asset.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
And that means the deformation on the muscles needs to propagate all the way to the fat layer.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
And that requires more solver iterations.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,640
I can double-click to go into the animal deformer asset.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,360
Next, let's go ahead and check do quad aesthetics.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,500
Let's first go to quad aesthetics.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,540
Because we're running a quad aesthetics simulation.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,220
And then make sure we're training on the skin.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
So, set the skeletal mesh to be the skin.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,060
Now, we should be able to see the skin.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,800
And over here, we're going to use the gaussetl solver.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,300
For training animation, this is designed for quad aesthetics.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,760
Let's go ahead and give the animation that we ran simulation on.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,840
For now, we're turning off the spring collision.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,340
That would be the major motion simulation.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,760
Because the collision scenario is pretty complicated,

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,620
we turn it on as this is the ground truth of the simulation.

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,960
And that checks collisions against every single connected geometry group.

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,820
Once that's set, we should have a training base and target mesh for training to learn from.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,360
For example, at the elbow.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,140
Next, we should set up the network inputs.

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,580
For now, let's skip that.

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,060
These are the joints that will serve as inputs to the network.

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,100
So, let's go ahead and click this plus button.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,260
Because that's currently incompatible with gaussetl solver.

34
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,840
And for this example, let's just add all animated bones.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,540
And make sure you might want to add only the major bones.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,240
So that the pain in muscles, the biceps, and the lower pectoralis can contract.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,260
Going down here.

38
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,260
For this simulation, let's set the other animation.

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,120
Which is the range of motion.

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,420
We only have 150 frames.

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,920
Coming down here.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,120
Let's set a new cache collection.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,560
Let's set to be 100.

44
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,560
For a fast training.

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,940
Now we should be able to see the difference between the fact

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,540
and the ground truth, which is our simulation results.

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,340
Let's run a little bit longer.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
You can see these little line segments.

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,160
They represent 5 seconds at 30 frames per second.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,640
So 150 frames in total.

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,740
Now we can start training the model.

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,160
So now let's hit that red record button to start a simulation.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,540
Once you hit that, the solver should start running in the background.

54
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,600
For some initial setups of the simulation.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,100
You can see that you should be able to see a notification window soon.

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,500
There...

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Because we have more vertices in the simulation, this should take more time in general.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,940
And also we're using a higher number of sub steps and iterations.

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,800
Now the ML deformer is trained.

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,980
We can validate the results by going into the testing tab.

61
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Come back later.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,680
Let's go ahead and hit the play.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,640
Let's go ahead and start viewing the simulation.

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,580
Pay attention to the lower pectoralis there.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,220
As it's contracting with the arms coming down.

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:42,980
And next thing is also set ground truth.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,820
Compare it with the ground truth.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,960
Something that's pretty useful is this heat map option.

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
So let's check that.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,220
Now that we have a simulation of the fat.

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,960
And that will show you...

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,220
Let's transfer the deformation on the fat.

73
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Where the vertex deltas are being applied.

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,140
Onto the skin.

75
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,900
Because that's what we'll see eventually.

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,160
We can embed the skin into the fat tetrahedral mesh.

77
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,360
Barycentrically.

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,740
And interpolate the skin from the simulation results.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,540
So let's go ahead and get back to the data photograph.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,120
You can see when the arms coming down.

81
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,640
We're seeing a lot of the vertex deltas.

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,520
From the surface bindings.

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,180
Here.

84
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,460
Because we're adding muscle contraction.

85
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,620
To the ground truth.

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,720
What this node does.

87
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,440
Is that.

88
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,400
It takes either a static mesh.

89
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
Or a skeletal mesh.

90
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,400
And then embeds.

91
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,420
All the vertices.

92
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,820
You can also see a lot of.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,560
Like vertex deltas.

94
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Being applied around the shoulder.

95
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,980
And this is due to.

96
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,660
So let's go ahead and set the skeletal mesh.

97
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,300
To be skin.

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,980
Volume preservation.

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
When the arms coming down.

100
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,960
We're also getting.

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,140
Some deformation from elasticity.

102
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,940
On the shoulder.

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,100
Because it's being stretched.

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,200
To make sure that we connect that.

105
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,120
To the collection.

106
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,700
So we.

107
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,240
We can also.

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,760
Use another.

109
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,160
To the fat layer.

110
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,620
So.

111
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,160
Remember we got the fat layer.

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,480
From here.

113
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,900
Let's go ahead and set.

114
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,520
The lift weights.

115
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,760
Which is not included.

116
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,460
In the training.

117
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,640
So.

118
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,860
We can safely do it here.

119
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,140
And this time.

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,700
Let's get rid of the ground truth.

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Because now it's evaluating.

122
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,340
It's finished.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,140
And then connect the collection.

124
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,620
Back in.

125
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Now we can play through the animation.

126
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,880
Remember all the.

127
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,560
Barocentric.

128
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,260
Data.

129
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,300
Stored here.

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,200
Will be.

131
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,840
Automatically updated.

132
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,720
Through.

133
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,320
Something to notice.

134
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,000
Is that.

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,440
The ground.

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,640
This pose.

137
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,420
When the arm is fully bent.

138
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,960
On the appended.

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,060
Muscle contraction.

140
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,960
On the bicep.

141
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,060
The reason.

142
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,620
Is that.

143
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,580
In this note.

144
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,380
There is also.

145
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:30,960
The option.

146
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,440
Of not.

147
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,520
Surface projection.

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,660
Remember.

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,220
Not all the time.

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,480
That.

151
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,120
The skin.

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Will be.

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,260
Fully.

154
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:37,560
Therefore.

155
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,420
Is not expected.

156
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,040
To see.

157
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,720
Any bicep.

158
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,120
Contraction.

159
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,660
The scenario.

160
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,040
That.

161
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,680
The skin.

162
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,380
Is.

163
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,160
Provided.

164
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,600
Offset.

165
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,960
So.

166
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,780
Make sure.

167
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,800
That you leave.

168
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,220
This on.

169
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,740
The other.

170
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,800
Range of motion animation.

171
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Those outside.

172
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,760
Slightly outside.

173
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,440
Vertices.

174
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,300
So.

175
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,940
Now.

176
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,880
With this said.

177
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,980
We can go ahead.

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,660
And then.

179
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,200
Set up.

180
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,940
The geometry cache generation.

181
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,200
We can see.

182
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,840
Around here.

183
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Embedded.

184
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,920
Sculpture.

185
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Make sure.

186
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,740
There are some extreme.

187
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,960
Elbow bending.

188
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,840
Which is the skin.

189
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,000
And this is really good.

190
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,040
To try and set that.

191
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,020
In order.

192
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,720
For the.

193
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,620
Moldeformer.

194
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,440
Let's go ahead.

195
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,200
And click this.

196
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,280
New geometry cache.

197
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,280
And create.

198
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,340
New geometry.

199
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,040
So the solution.

200
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,900
Is to consider.

201
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,900
Using the whole animation.

202
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,980
As training data.

203
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,900
As it covers.

204
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,660
A lot of.

205
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,780
We're ready to generate.

206
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,880
Our geometry cache.

207
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,200
In general.

208
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,080
You should think about.

209
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,740
What animation.

210
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,780
That you apply.

211
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Onto the character.

212
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,680
For example.

213
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,380
In a game.

214
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,060
And also.

215
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
Your training data set.

216
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,420
In a way.

217
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,380
That all possible.

218
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,260
Joint angles.

219
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,060
Are covered.

220
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,460
In the range.

221
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,040
Of the training data.

222
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,940
This should be much faster.

223
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,500
Than the simulation.

224
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,540
Because we're only.

225
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,020
Reading the simulation results.

226
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
And interpolating.

227
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,120
The skin positions.

228
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,560
From that.

229
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,800
We can open up.

230
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,420
You can either construct.

231
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,320
A range of mouse.

232
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,300
In training animation.

233
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:01,740
Like this.

234
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Double click that.

235
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Or generate.

236
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,140
A random pose.

237
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,840
Data set.

238
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Within.

239
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,200
A large.

240
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,360
Joint rotation space.

241
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,640
For more information.

242
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,180
On training.

243
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,460
The ML deformer.

244
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,280
Please refer.

245
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,300
To the ML deformer.

246
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,760
Page.

247
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,540
Linked.

248
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,460
In the description.

249
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,900
And pay attention.

250
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,240
To that.

251
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,180
Let's use.

252
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,640
The train.

253
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,180
ML deformer.

254
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,460
To that.

255
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,240
And you can see.

256
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,680
To find.

257
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,920
ML deformer.

258
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,380
On 150 frames.

259
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,780
Of the bicep curl.

260
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,260
Simulation.

261
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,820
You can check.

262
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,800
The vertex deltas.

263
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,320
The arm.

264
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,220
That's introduced.

265
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,200
So as a recap.

266
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
We run.

267
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,020
A quasi-static simulation.

268
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,800
Of the muscles.

269
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
And fat layer.

270
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
We generated.

271
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,280
A geometry cache.

272
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:42,940
Of the skin.

273
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,720
From the left.

274
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,900
And the right side.

275
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,880
In the next video.

276
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,620
We use.

277
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
The geometry cache.

278
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,220
To train.

279
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,300
An ML deformer.

280
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,920
To start using.

281
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,520
The train.

282
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,320
ML deformer.

283
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,140
Let's go back.

284
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,600
To map.

285
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,320
Correctives.

286
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,820
And then.

287
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
On the character skin.

288
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,580
What physics.

289
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,180
And biomechanics.

290
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,940
Enhanced.

291
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,480
Click actor.

292
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,760
And I will rename this to.

293
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,800
Email.

294
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,440
Blueprint.

295
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,640
Let's go ahead and double click.

296
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,600
To open up that.

297
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Blueprint asset.

298
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,340
Click add button.

299
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
To add a skeletal mesh.

300
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,680
Component.

301
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,400
For the skeletal mesh.

302
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
Let's set it to be.

303
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,060
The skin skeletal mesh.

304
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,830
And also.

305
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,130
We want to turn on.

306
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,710
Mesh deformer.

307
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,210
Make sure to check that.

308
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,240
And then over here.

309
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,380
Under the gear button.

310
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:38,760
Here.

311
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,560
Make sure you have.

312
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Show engine content.

313
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,120
And show plugin content.

314
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,240
Both enabled.

315
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,440
So that you can see.

316
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,940
The deformer graph.

317
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,620
That we're going to use.

318
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,260
For example.

319
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,840
If you don't have the show engine content.

320
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,880
You will not see any.

321
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,080
Graphs there.

322
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,020
Make sure they're.

323
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,480
They're enabled.

324
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,820
And then we're going to use.

325
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,120
This.

326
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,200
DG underscore.

327
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,140
A multiformer model.

328
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,980
Let's go ahead.

329
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,640
And test this.

330
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,020
On.

331
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,720
An animation.

332
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,320
Select.

333
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,560
Use animation asset.

334
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,140
And then.

335
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,440
For example.

336
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,100
Let's use.

337
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,220
The one.

338
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,020
We trained on.

339
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,680
In this case.

340
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,760
The lip weight animation.

341
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,060
Now.

342
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,480
Let's go ahead.

343
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,960
And add.

344
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,800
The multiformer.

345
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,260
Component.

346
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,420
So.

347
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,580
For.

348
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,700
And over here.

349
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:29,880
At.

350
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,380
Multiformer.

351
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,900
Asset.

352
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,140
Let's set it to be.

353
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,340
The bicep curl.

354
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,540
Now.

355
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,100
That's pretty much.

356
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,460
Everything.

357
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:37,900
And then.

358
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,220
We can.

359
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,660
Click.

360
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,260
Compile.

361
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,080
And then.

362
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,440
Save.

363
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:41,960
The blueprint.

364
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:45,940
Now.

365
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,520
We can drag.

366
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,000
The blueprint.

367
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,320
Out.

368
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,640
In the map.

369
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,220
I can.

370
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,620
Reset.

371
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,060
It's.

372
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,980
Transforms.

373
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,690
Let's.

374
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,010
Let's go ahead.

375
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,430
And rotate.

376
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,070
A little bit.

377
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,650
So that.

378
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,250
It's facing.

379
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,670
The sun.

380
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,550
For better lighting.

381
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,620
Now.

382
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,300
If we click.

383
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,900
Simulate.

384
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,560
We'll see.

385
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,140
The ml deformer.

386
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,440
Results.

387
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,160
Being applied.

388
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:12,880
Onto.

389
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,740
The skeletal mesh.

390
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,900
For example.

391
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,240
There.

392
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,100
Let's.

393
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,460
Zoom in.

394
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:20,900
Onto.

395
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,480
The bicep.

396
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,560
There.

397
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,080
You can see.

398
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,620
Bicep.

399
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,100
Contraction.

400
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,400
There.

401
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,860
And.

402
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,380
That's the end.

403
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,020
Of the series.

404
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,760
Of the tutorial.

405
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,940
Have fun.

406
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,500
Setting up.

407
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,060
Your simulation.
