1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Wait, put your hands together, please.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,460
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,220
I'm Karl Sakaki.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,580
I make feeling in Japan.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm very happy to be invited to the summit.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,240
So since I'm not really used to English,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,520
I'll be switching back to Pixelogic Daisuke

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,820
to be the translator for this presentation.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,240
So I want to introduce you to the workflow,

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
what I do to make figurines in Japan.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,560
So I would like to show you some introductions of my work

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,180
for some showcases of what I do as a work.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,440
So this work is representing, well, this work is for the book itself,

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,880
and this is showcasing a lot of like ZBrush techniques in the book.

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,480
This is a figurine of Kaguya Luna.

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,940
It's a popular character in Japan, and this was made by Wonderful Works,

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:50,780
which is his company, and this is one of his like figurines of his company's work.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,880
So this was ordered by Kotobukiya and made by him.

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,860
So this was ordered by Kotobukiya and made by him.

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,540
So this is a figurine which just came out yesterday in Japan, I guess?

21
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,120
And it is his latest work on Wonder Festival.

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,920
No. Sorry.

23
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,140
Wonderful Works. Sorry.

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:01,140
So this character is from Liza's Atoria, and this is coming out on September 26th?

25
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,500
Yes.

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,280
And yeah, so this is the main character of the game.

27
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:25,500
This is the first image you saw is like 1 7th of the scale, but this is the human scale,

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,060
so full scale shown on Tokyo Game Show.

29
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:45,580
So his company and his work will do like a lot of scales, like big human size scales and small scales which you can buy and store it in your house.

30
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:15,280
So for this presentation, he will be showcasing you the same character artists, character designer who did the Liza's Atoria's character.

31
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:25,120
Toridamono-san, and this character was designed by himself, and this is one of his original characters, Kimaira-chan.

32
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,840
So this is the 3D data for the character he just showed you.

33
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,240
So he will be showcasing you first how he made the cloths.

34
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,840
So he will be showcasing you first how he made the cloths.

35
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,400
He will first make the character's base, then he will pose it first, then after that he will make the cloths.

36
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,220
Then, hello.

37
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,180
Um...

38
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,920
T-PoseとかA-Stanceとかの状態から先に服とかを作ってその後にポーズを取るという方法もありますしそうやっている方もいらっしゃいますけど自分の場合は先にT

39
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,680
-Poseで服を作り始めると無駄に作り込んじゃうとフィギュアの場合は必ず左右非対称になるので左右対称の状態でそこまでも作らなくていいと

40
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,560
ほどほどでポーズを取っていけばいいんですけど自分がちょっと貴重な性格もあって無駄に作り込んじゃうのでそういったことが無駄なのでもうポーズを取ってから服を作るようにしています

41
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,660
So a lot of artists use T-Pose or A-Poses

42
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,900
So then you build the whole character itself and then after that

43
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,860
you pose with the clothes on

44
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,160
but for his workflow mainly he

45
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,380
the final pose itself is asymmetric

46
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
so it's not symmetric

47
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,600
so he thinks that he would be better off

48
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
making some cloths just after doing some poses

49
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,260
So he's using masks and extract functions

50
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,900
to actually make some cloths

51
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,180
and he will just show you how to make some cloths from itこのマスクの段階は大まかな当たりだけ取れればいいのであまり細かいところまで正確に書かなくても大丈夫です

52
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,740
So he's just making some rough shapes from the body itself

53
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,060
and he doesn't really go into detail for the mask itself

54
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,770
So he's fine with this result

55
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,570
and he's going to go through the extraction function

56
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:34,390
So when applying the extract function

57
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,550
you put off the double option and the thickness option to zero

58
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,390
so you don't have any thickness on the model

59
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,910
厚みとかは後でつけるのでまずは厚みのない状態で作りましてこれでマスクのところから切り出されたエクストラクターのメッシュが出るんですけどこれがマスクより大きくなっちゃうのでこれをエッジループのエッジループマスクのボーダーで切り取ります

60
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,570
So he will apply the thickness afterwards

61
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,070
and since the extract function will take out

62
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,770
a bit more bigger area than the actual mask itself

63
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,470
he will apply some deletes

64
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,870
to actually remove the additional parts of the masking itself

65
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,330
So after that he will go through the zero-remesher functions

66
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:45,950
So after that he will go through the zero-remesher functions

67
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:54,470
because he had some polygroups on and after that he is going to first put a higher setting on the polycounts

68
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,330
Then after getting the results he is going to reduce the polycounts for a better control

69
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,650
多めのポリゴンからポリゴンの流れを整えつつ少ないポリゴンに減らしていきます

70
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,630
So since like if you have a character's body and if you have a spine going through the middle you want the middle to be like a

71
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,010
completely in the middle of the part

72
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:48,390
So you control this by applying a split on the polygroups

73
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,930
Then after that you apply a zero-remesher with it

74
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,990
So when applying the zero-remesher

75
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,090
he wants a better topology on the model

76
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,950
so he doesn't want a spiral on the model itself

77
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,600
Now this is a lower polycounts you can see from the model

78
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Why do you like this?

79
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,620
Polygon's流れを気にしているかというとこれは例えば悪い例のポリゴンの流れなんですけど後ろのここですねこことかに三角ポリゴンとかが集中したりしているところがあるんですけどこういうところに対してスカルプト例えばここをディバイドして服の塩を入れようと思ってスカルプトした場合にスムースとかを使うと

80
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,010
ポリゴンに引っ張られて形が崩れてしまうところがどうしても出てしまいます

81
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:08,950
So you might wonder why he's taking so much time to consider the topology itself

82
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,810
and this is one of the reasons

83
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,170
and this is a bad example

84
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,470
and you can see it from the topology

85
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,470
it's not clean

86
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,570
and if you don't have the clean topology

87
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,290
and if you sculpt on top of it

88
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,070
you will lose the details

89
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,910
and you don't really get the clean result you want

90
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,010
and that is one of the reasons why he takes a bit of time to actually clean up the topology

91
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:59,910
So on the left you can see it's the first topology result which is high poly counts

92
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,450
and in the middle you have middle poly counts with the poly groups

93
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,450
and then you refine that with on the right hand side model

94
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,090
and that is the final result

95
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:34,760
and this is what the base mesh would be like for the sculpting for the after process

96
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,240
So since when you sculpt on a flat one-sided polygons

97
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,380
it's not really going to get a good result

98
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,240
so you will apply a thickness right now

99
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,220
厚みをつけるときはVModelerのエクストルードではなくてMorphターゲットの機能を使いますなぜかというとVModelerのエクストルードで厚みをつけるとこれですね内側の方のポリグループが全部一緒になってしまうのでこれを避けたいので表も裏も同じポリグループになるようにMorphターゲットの機能を使います

100
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,060
So you may know ZBrush has a couple of ways

101
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,840
to add thickness to the model, but he

102
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,980
is going to use MorphTarget to make the thickness.

103
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,720
One of the reasons is that when you use Demodeler

104
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:43,660
to add extrude, it's only going to generate one polygroup

105
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,220
in the inside of the mesh.

106
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,560
So you can see that it was generating red polygroups

107
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,300
inside the mesh.

108
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,380
So he used the store-morph function

109
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,440
to actually store the initial mesh.

110
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
And then he uses a transpose inflate function

111
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,980
to adjust the thickness.

112
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
And looking at the units of the transpose units,

113
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,340
he is considering how much thick the model will get

114
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,560
get after applying a create div function.

115
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,720
So after pressing the create div, you have a model which has

116
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,140
the thickness.

117
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,860
So after applying the flip,

118
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,120
you can see from the top that there was a huge hole in the middle of the cloth,

119
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,220
but when you're making a figurine, you want that kind of like hole to be closed.

120
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:50,500
So he did some like Dmulder's close hole function to actually close these kind of holes,

121
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,900
and you now have a firm piece of cloth to actually sculpt on.

122
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,040
So you can see from the model that the crease is applied.

123
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:33,920
So he was demonstrating first, he applied the divide function without the crease,

124
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,580
and it was getting really, really rounded.

125
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,740
But after you apply the crease, you have a more sharper edge on the result.

126
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,540
So after the base mesh is done, he will be sculpting the details of the cloth,

127
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,500
and he will store all the details in the layer function.

128
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,400
So he's using his custom-made brush, which is available on Gumroad,

129
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,420
and he's using the SK-cloth brush.

130
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,580
So he's using a wide stroke first, then after making the broad strokes,

131
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:40,260
then you make a brush smaller, then you get into detail to actually make the folds.

132
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,460
And one question, how many of you use SK brushes?

133
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,740
Thank you.

134
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,400
A couple, you guys.

135
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,140
Thanks.

136
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,140
Just Google SK brush or Sakaki Kaoru, and you will see a Gumroad shop,

137
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:10,780
and then you can download his entire IMM brushes and the entire SK-cloth and SK-clay fill.

138
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,780
And it's really useful for figurines.

139
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,240
I think Toma will post a URL for the Gumroad.

140
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,460
Yeah.

141
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:55,030
So there is one brush he would like to recommend.

142
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,990
It's a brush called Smooth-Groove Brushes.

143
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,250
Smooth-Groove Brushes.

144
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,490
So there is one brush he would like to recommend.

145
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,150
And which is located inside the Lightbrow box and in the Smooth Folder.

146
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,390
And you can see it from the file.

147
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,470
And if you click it, there will be a brush for it.

148
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:19,010
So, when you apply the Smoothie brush to add the Curvepoint brush,

149
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,590
you can see theст

150
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,910
but it makes it enormistles.

151
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,470
This is with your edge when we release anymore.

152
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,550
So when you apply the Smoothie brush,

153
00:19:40,190 --> 00:20:00,530
So when you're applying the smooth brush, and if you normally apply a smooth brush, the corners of the mesh will get rounded, but since you're using a smooth group brushes, and he's applying a separate group on the edge of the model, like the thickness of the corner of the model,

154
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:10,050
so when he uses the smooth group brushes, it's not going to affect the different polygroup type of the model.

155
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:47,150
So there is another brush you want to recommend. It's a smooth directional brush, which is located in the lightbox, smooth, and you can find it there.

156
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:58,250
And this brush will consider which direction you're moving your brush, and then smooth the model accordingly.

157
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:07,390
So if you want the cloth to follow those kind of strokes, then you can clean it up after that.

158
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:37,110
So if you use a normal smooth brush, it will make, like, after you apply a fold to it, then use a smooth brush.

159
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:53,990
It will, like, shrink the details after you sculpted, so it will, like, it will get rid of your sculpt after you sculpted, but when you use the smooth directional brush, it's going to maintain those kind of details.

160
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:23,310
So since smooth directional brush will just consider the brush stroke directions, it's going to maintain the details, which was...

161
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,750
what you wanted to sculpt in the first place.

162
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,000
So we can fill it, like, over the same time.

163
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,440
This brush, I'll get rid of it.

164
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:47,580
So let me make sure the seamless brush are done with it.

165
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,220
These parts of the advantages are already Avengers.

166
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,720
This is When you start with fluid Advisory.

167
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,960
Okay, so you can draw this to help you manage biggerg空中 and acting.

168
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:57,980
This is fun because of this match .

169
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,080
It's OK.

170
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,360
It's ok.

171
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,640
If I push these part of the line.

172
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:14,400
So one of the reason why he used the layer function is that he wanted to store this kind of like roundness afterwards on the cloth's edge.

173
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,480
So if you apply some like polish afterwards, you can store it differently in a different layer.

174
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,880
So he made a secondary layer on the model.

175
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,460
So he's like applying some polish or the smooth on the corner of the model.

176
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,100
So you can have the roundness stored separately on the model.

177
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:06,800
So he just selected the thickness part of the model and then apply a mask to it and then reverse it, apply a blur to it and then applying some control to it.

178
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,320
So he applied a smooth on top of it.

179
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,360
Move.

180
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,860
Move.

181
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,800
Move.

182
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,060
Move.

183
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,620
So he also applied a roundness using a move brush.

184
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:53,040
So after selecting the thickness part and then reversing it, then applying a blur to it, then he has a better control

185
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,520
of the roundness and the corners.

186
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,780
Then he wanted to apply a polish on top.

187
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:17,380
So one of the reasons why he's doing this is that if you just have a thickness and without the roundness, it feels like a mech part and it's not like the cloth you're looking for.

188
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,340
So this is one of the reasons why he's applying this kind of actions onto the model.

189
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:54,320
So since he has a separate layer just storing the roundness of the corners, now if you apply some smoothness,

190
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:05,100
groups to make that kind of like corners accidentally round, but since it's stored separately, it's going to maintain that kind of roundness and you have a better control over it.

191
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:30,480
So using this kind of like layer functions makes your model kind of like robust compared to the stuff you're required to do.

192
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Like if you have a design change of the model, you can do it non-destructively and effectively.これが最終的にできたデータで、まずここにシワのレイヤーが入って、厚みを丸めるレイヤー、あとはここのライン状のディティールのレイヤーと全部分けて入れてあります。

193
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,620
これが最終的にできたデータで、まずここにシワのレイヤーが入って、厚みを丸めるレイヤー、あとはここのライン状のディティールのレイヤーと全部分けて入れてあります。

194
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:08,620
So you can see there's several layers that stores several kind of details, like the folds itself, the lines and the broad strokes of the model.以上が服の自分の作り方です。

195
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,620
以上が服の自分の作り方です。

196
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,900
So this is the cloth process that he usually do.

197
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,900
Any reactions?

198
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,080
Any questions?

199
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,400
Any claps?

200
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,680
Any reactions?

201
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,980
Any reactions?

202
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,420
Yeah.

203
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,340
Thank you.

204
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,540
So next he will be showing you how to make the hairs for the figurines.

205
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,650
髪の毛はIMMブラシを使って作成していきます。IMMブラシも自分の制作したカスタムブラシでSKHairっていうブラシを用意しています。

206
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:16,630
So for the hairs, he's going to use the IMM brushes, IMMカーブ brushes, and he has his own set of custom IMM brushes.

207
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:23,890
It's called SKHair, which is included in the Gumroad's download link if you can share it.

208
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,270
Yeah, done.

209
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:26,590
Okay.

210
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,250
That's included in the pack.

211
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,890
So yeah, you can download it.まず今このように頭に対して髪の毛のラインを1本引こうとするとこのように髪の毛の草が1本できます。これは少し動かしたり、あとはブラシサイズで太さを変えたり、あとはこのVintensityの部分で、

212
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,430
厚みを変えたりできますので、これでこのイラストにあった部分を変えたり、まず、このように頭に対して髪の毛のラインを1本引こうとすると、このように髪の毛の草が1本できます。これは少し動かしたり、あとはブラシサイズで太さを変えたり、あとはこのVintensityの部分で厚みを変えたりできますので、

213
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,930
これでこのイラストにあった髪の毛の幅とか太さとかをまずざっくりと調整します。

214
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:14,710
Also as you know, IMM Car Brushes allow you to change the thickness using the Z-Intensity settings

215
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:24,610
and you can change the thickness or the size of the brush itself by using the size sliders.

216
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:33,890
So he's adjusting and looking at the illustration itself and comparing that and making the first initial hair shine.

217
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,370
正確な形状はこのカーブ上で調整せずに後からムーブブラシで動かしていくので、まずは大まかにだけカーブを配置するようにしています。

218
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,050
So he's going to adjust it later using the Move Brushes.

219
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:02,710
So he's now just making some broad strokes and basic shapes using the IMM Curves.

220
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,590
で、IMM Curveを使うときの注意点として、このベースの頭の方のオブジェクトに対しては、サブディビジョンレベルとか、先ほど必要に作っていたレイヤーとかは全て無しにしないとIMM

221
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,550
Curveは作れないので注意してください。

222
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:30,670
So one of the restrictions in the IMM brushes is that you can't really use a subdivision mesh

223
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,610
on the base of the, like for example on the head itself.

224
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,830
You can't really apply a subdivision or a layer.

225
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,010
So you need to store that kind of like subtool separately.

226
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,390
So usually you just duplicate the subtool and delete all those kind of like data.

227
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,670
And you just use that as a base mesh and delete it afterwards

228
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,710
if you apply some IMM Curves.で、日本のフィギュアで求められるのはキャラクターの絵にどれだけ似てるかっていうのが求められますので顔に対しての髪の毛の割合とか長さとか毛先の位置とかというのをきっちりと絵に合わせるように心がけながらこのようにムーブブラシで位置を調整します。

229
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,910
一方のものを日本のフィギュアで求められるのは日本のフィギュアで求められるのはキャラクターの絵にどれだけ似てるかっていうのが求められますので顔に対しての髪の毛の割合とか長さとか毛先の位置とかというのをきっちりと絵に合わせるように心がけながら

230
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,790
こんなふうにムーブブラシで位置を調整します。日本のアーティストが多く問われているのはイルストレーションに対応する必要があります。3Dモデルに対応する必要があります。

231
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,810
このようにブラシで調整していくんですけれども

232
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,890
例えば先ほど言った絵に合わせるという点では髪の毛の表と裏の境目とかこういうところに模型を使って今位置調整をしています。なぜかというとこちらの今作ろうとしているイラストの絵を見るとイラストの髪っていうのは裏面が描かれることはほとんどないですね。表面しか描かれないので

233
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,150
3Dだからといって安易に裏面が見えるような配置の仕方をするとなんか似てないねっていうふうになるのでそういったことがないように注意しています。So

234
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:54,090
one tips that he's gonna give that when making or considering the hairs, you can't really make

235
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,990
the hairs really really thick.Especially on the side hairs,

236
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,450
if you make the hairs thick and because the 3D

237
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,970
requires to do those kind of stuff,

238
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,250
you can't really make the thickness really big

239
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:15,110
because it will be really not close to the illustration.

240
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,410
And illustration usually has a thin one stroke of a line

241
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,850
for the thickness of the hairs.

242
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:27,890
So you need to replicate those kind of thickness to the 3D.And

243
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,290
you have a lot of ways to flip the hairs strands

244
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:41,270
to make it look thin or combining with the other hairs to make it stabler.And

245
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,970
those kind of like tips will be shown here.

246
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,390
そこからIMMブラシで髪の毛の配置をしていった後の状態がこのようになります。So

247
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:05,030
this is basically the rough shape after the IMM brushes are set.And this will

248
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,170
be the base mesh

249
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:18,950
for the process he's going to show afterwards.この状態だとこのIMMブラシで配置した毛の一本一本は今のところまだ全部離れています。So

250
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,830
in this case you can see

251
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,210
thatone strand of the hair is separate polygroups.So you can see like

252
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,830
one polygroup is applied on one strand.

253
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,390
このようなIMMブラシで作っているときに毛先とかを尖らせたいという場合があると思いますけどそういった場合で一番簡単なのは毛先だけマスクしてそれをブラーその上でトランスポーズかギズモでもいいんですけどもスケールで細くしてあげるとこうやって毛先を尖らせることが簡単になります。So

254
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,970
one tip you can use when you are making the hairs

255
00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:01,250
like look sharp you can mask the tip of the hairsand

256
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,180
then apply a scale to itto

257
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,970
make it really really thin and sharp.Gizmo

258
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,970
is okay.You can use

259
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,430
like the transpose.he uses transpose

260
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,230
because he's an oldtime zebra schuza

261
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,330
and like a lot of artistslike to use transpose or

262
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,870
gizmo so you can use both

263
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,430
and it's basically the same.If

264
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,870
you apply mask and then scale it, it's the same result.で、ここから作り込んでいくときにこのままディバイドしてこうやってディテールを入れていくのではなく自分の場合はまずダイナメッシュで全部くっつけてしまいます。

265
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:54,090
So of course there is a way just after this like applying a divide on top of the modeland

266
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,810
then going directly to the details but he doesn't do this kind of stuff.

267
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,050
で、ダイナメッシュのレゾリューションの数値ですけれどもこれ自体に必ず毎回いくつっていう数値が決まってるわけじゃなくて作るものの大きさとポリゴンの細かさによって毎回数値はちょっと変わってます。で、大体今お見せしているような細かさぐらいであればいいかなっていうので感覚で数値を選んでます。

268
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,130
So you can see that he applied a Dynamesh onto the hairs firstand

269
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,130
then he explained thatwhen

270
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,370
you're choosing the resolutionsDynamesh

271
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,230
doesn't really have a set resolutionit's depending on

272
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,210
the size of the modeland you can see

273
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,550
a whole new video about this kind of stuffin the Ask Zrush

274
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:50,750
section done by Josephbut the size of the modelhas

275
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,570
a huge impact on the Dynamesh

276
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,030
result

277
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,140
and so he's eyeballing the resultand

278
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,990
like seeing how much of the resolution he needs to apply to the mesh

279
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,710
ここからくっつけたところの溝を滑らかに埋めていくんですけれども通常のスムースですと結構ハイポリゴンになっているのでならすのが大変です。そこで自分がよく使うのはこれも自分のカスタムブラシですけれどもSKクレイフィルっていうブラシを使います。

280
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,910
so he is applying a smooth on top of the hairsbecause

281
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:29,110
the original IMM brush hairshas

282
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,710
separate kind of strandsand

283
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,910
you don't want those kind of strands really really separatelyand

284
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,070
you want some strands to showbut

285
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,530
you want some of the bumps and the segments to be non-visible

286
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,690
so you are applying a Dynamesh for that reasonand

287
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,530
he is filling those kind of like separationsusing

288
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,530
his own SKクレイフィルto

289
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,530
fill up those kind of like segmentsso

290
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,530
you can see some of the hair strands now looks more unifiedso

291
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,510
it's now one part

292
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,350
ブラシの効果まで説明しましたこのブラシはSKクレイフィルhas

293
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,970
a functionthat he is

294
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,470
likewhen applying a Dynameshand

295
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,870
if you apply

296
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,750
a smooth on top

297
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,090
of itbecause it's a high

298
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,610
resolutionit's really hard to controland clean up

299
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,910
the bumps

300
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,030
but like he combined thehe

301
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,130
used the function of a clayand

302
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,210
using that to fill up the segmentsand

303
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,750
make it easy for the high resolution meshto

304
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,910
be able to be filled and managed and controlledSKクレイフィルでこのように

305
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,170
えっとSKクレイフィルでこのようにえっとおまかに溝を埋めていってえっと最後に細かい凹凸のところだけえっと凸凹だけはえっと通常のスムースでならしていきますでこのときえっとまあスムースかかってんのかかかってないのかよくわかんないんですけどえっとキーボードの1を連打するこれはリピートストロークでしたっけ

306
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,250
で前と同じストロークの動作をするのでえっとまあ要するにスムースを何十回も同じようにかけているという効果が現れるのでダイナメッシュでやっているようなハイポリゴンに対してもスムースがかかりやすくなります

307
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,990
本当に少しなきゃいけないなさらに切り替わりの嘴かんでせる

308
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:51,850
smooth brush, and then you can use the one key on the keyboard, like one. So it

309
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:58,090
repeats the brush stroke you've done just before, so it will just repeat the

310
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:04,490
same smooth on top of the places where you just apply the smooth on so just

311
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,870
pressing the one key will just repeat the stroke of the smooth so it makes the

312
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,350
and the bumps disappear.

313
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,310
So now he's going to go to the detail of the hair

314
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,070
and he is using an SK slash brush for these kind of strokes.

315
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,550
So the way he goes about sculpting the details,

316
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,250
first he applies the basic strokes,

317
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,870
which is shown on the illustration itself.

318
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,630
And you can see this like sandable sign on the hair,

319
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,510
but because this was really visible on the illustration,

320
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,310
it's a key part of the character.

321
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,330
So he's applying this kind of like key design first,

322
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,950
then after that he's going to go to the details

323
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,010
to actually apply some strokes afterwards.

324
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,590
So,

325
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:13,650
So, if you just follow along the illustrations, like key designs, there's like a lot of parts that feels like bland, that you need more details on top of it.

326
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:30,050
That is the part where the figurine artist can thrive, that you can apply some details that you can apply from the stuff that is not on the original illustrations.

327
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:10,490
So you can see from how he did the strokes, like if you apply the strokes on the edge of

328
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:19,050
the hair, so you can see it just applying a C curve, and this looks like a segment between

329
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,470
the front and the back of the hair.

330
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,910
So you need to be careful that this looks like a thickness of the model, the thickness

331
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,950
of the hair itself.

332
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:36,970
So where you draw this kind of like harsh line makes the difference between the thick hair

333
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,270
and the thin hair.

334
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:46,590
This is kind of the illusion we're working on, like this is like you are making it really

335
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:53,670
look flat, but it's not actually flat, and like some of the stuff is like really like

336
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,190
illusional in a way in Japanese figurines.

337
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,510
エッジを入れるところの位置も気をつけて、このように表面だけが見えるような

338
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,730
エッジのつけ方にして、さらにまだ裏面がちょっと見えるような形になっているので、ここですね今動かしてるところですけども、ここを奥に引っ込めることで正面から見て、なるべく裏面が見えないように。

339
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:35,670
So now he wants to consider how much the back of the hair is visible from the front.

340
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:45,070
So he's applying a mask, and then controlling where the separation between the front and the back occurs.

341
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,410
So after applying some details, this is the final result he got.

342
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,320
So you can see some of the details is not really visible on the illustrations.

343
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:56,180
So he applied it himself, and this is where he looks at the character's designs and considers what kind of details he can add.

344
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,320
So first of all, we're going to see how much the back of the hair is visible.

345
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,280
Why do you think that the hair is visible?

346
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,140
they get it or anything.

347
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,000
Objects are all different.

348
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,320
It may be synced by all of the objects.

349
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,600
It will be connected to all of the objects that are connected to all of the objects.

350
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:26,160
If you're at the figure design,

351
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,900
you can make it in the same way.

352
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,380
In fact, it's not an option to make it similar to you.

353
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:51,080
So, as you can see, on the back of the characters, there is no separation line on the character, like there is no separation on the back of the hair, right?

354
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:59,120
So, this is the reason mainly why he wants the Dynamesh to be applied in the hair.

355
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:14,320
And there is a couple of figurine artists in Japan who likes the hair to be split, but he wants this to be unified, so he has better control of the shadows of the model if the light is cast.

356
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:31,000
So, this is the whole presentation itself.

357
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:44,050
So, he is fine with the questions. If you have any questions, I can translate it.

358
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,090
I can't see where you are, I am sorry. Did I hurt you? I got a good lawyer.

359
00:47:54,990 --> 00:48:08,630
I am Logan. You mentioned earlier that you do all your stuff asymmetrically. Do you actually have, do you ever come across a reason to do it, say, in an A pose?

360
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,670
A pose? A pose?

361
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,630
A pose? A pose.

362
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,330
例えば、対象に作らないといけないモデルだったりとか、Aポーズとか、基本的なポーズを求められるようなモデルはあったか?

363
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:37,310
I was told by being an action figure,動くフィギュアはもちろん左右対象のままで、他にはメカのパーツとかですね。

364
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:53,470
If you have a little bit of a Meka-like design, you can make it in a stance, and then move it into a pose.

365
00:48:53,470 --> 00:49:01,930
So for the action figurines, you can see that it's really basic pose, the initial pose.

366
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,270
and those kind of figurines

367
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,550
and like

368
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,510
for the characters which has

369
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,830
mech parts

370
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,510
those kind of mech parts are

371
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,650
really

372
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,210
needs to be symmetrical but

373
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,510
he's applying

374
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,890
those kind of like parts

375
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,950
afterwards

376
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,350
first making it symmetrical then

377
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,750
splitting apart to the

378
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:29,870
poses

379
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:33,110
which needs to be placed so he's applying

380
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,510
the parts

381
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,430
he made afterwards to the pose

382
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,250
itselfもう一つ言うと自分の仕事だとクライアントがいて修正の指示をされるというケースが多いので先ほど言った左右対称のパーツもせっかく腕に配置したのにちょっと直してと言われて左右対称の形状に戻ってまた持ってくるというのが

383
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,010
何度も繰り返されるということがありましたあまりにもそれが多いんでその時は腕の方に板ポリを配置してナノメッシュで配置する

384
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,270
という方法を取りました

385
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,930
so his work

386
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,170
has a client

387
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,530
and his client

388
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,210
sometimes require him

389
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,250
to do some

390
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,230
rethinking

391
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,890
or redo

392
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,570
on the model

393
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,370
and

394
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,990
there was one case

395
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,090
that he had

396
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,850
a lot of retakes

397
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,410
and he had to

398
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,950
use the nanomesh

399
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,530
to replace that part

400
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,890
so nanomesh

401
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,430
will make an instance

402
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,210
of the mesh

403
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,370
and you put

404
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,810
a flat plane

405
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,150
polygon

406
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,050
on top of it

407
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,030
and then replace

408
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:44,570
that part

409
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,390
with the nanomesh

410
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,850
so there was one case

411
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,850
that he had to do that

412
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,370
it's a nice little trick there

413
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,450
go ahead

414
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:53,850
oh yes

415
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,310
I'm asking for my sensei

416
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,270
you're asking

417
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,070
shoe sensei

418
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:57,590
yes

419
00:50:58,570 --> 00:50:59,410
he was asking

420
00:50:59,410 --> 00:50:59,990
about like

421
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,630
the nanomesh

422
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,650
of the back of the hair

423
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:02,410
when you're like

424
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,250
doing actual

425
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:03,970
3D printing

426
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,930
do you have to do it

427
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,870
in dynamesh

428
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:07,510
or

429
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,390
would you

430
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,170
would you like

431
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,310
remesh it a bit

432
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,090
remesh it a bit

433
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,030
or the final result

434
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,430
should be

435
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,810
so he just applies

436
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,670
the dynamesh

437
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,570
and then afterwards

438
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,070
then if he has

439
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:40,710
the final result

440
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,410
he would just

441
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,250
use the decimation master

442
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,510
to decimate it

443
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:44,930
and then

444
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,350
that would be

445
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:46,870
the final result

446
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,710
so it's okay

447
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,390
to use the animation

448
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,970
of course

449
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:49,190
yeah

450
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,450
the final result

451
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,950
is going to be

452
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,510
handled through

453
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,450
the decimation master

454
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,130
so that it can be

455
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:53,690
processed through

456
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,270
the 3D printing

457
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,250
at that point

458
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,870
it's going to leave

459
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,510
ZBrush anyway

460
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,030
and go into

461
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,990
proprietary software

462
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,510
smarter than I look

463
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,390
hold on

464
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,830
hi

465
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:07,790
hi

466
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,490
my name is Nabil

467
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,330
that was a

468
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,070
great work

469
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,110
but I have a question

470
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,470
like

471
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,150
you don't feel like

472
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,830
you're limited

473
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,470
like for example

474
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,050
like to do

475
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,130
to the 2D

476
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:18,770
like line

477
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,590
some lines

478
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:19,990
are like

479
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,970
not intentional

480
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:21,510
they're like

481
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,610
just happy accident

482
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,390
you don't feel

483
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:23,930
like you're

484
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,210
like attached

485
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,230
to those lines

486
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,070
like for example

487
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,650
in the hair

488
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,110
you were like

489
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:28,570
following

490
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,750
the lightning

491
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:30,950
zigzag

492
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,230
like

493
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,930
you don't feel

494
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,390
like you're

495
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:33,550
like

496
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,390
limited

497
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:38,310
you don't feel

498
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,790
like you're

499
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,530
like I will

500
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,570
似せる中でも滲み出る個性というか、すごく似てるんだけど、このデザイナーが作ったなって分かるような個性がフィギュアにそれぞれ出てくるので、

501
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,450
みんなに好まれる造形をしつつも、坂木香織が作ったなっていうような個性っていうのを分かるようにできればいいなと思っているので、作ってるのはすごく楽しいです。

502
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:48,510
So there is some Japanese artists who don't like to follow the illustration's likeliness entirely,

503
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:54,750
or they will keep some part of it and then they will put their original taste to it.

504
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:04,430
But he likes to follow the illustration's likeliness first, then apply some original taste to it,

505
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:12,990
which is not really like a limitation, it's more, what do you call those, spice to it?

506
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,070
It's more like a secret additive.

507
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,530
Secret sauce.

508
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:20,250
Yeah, then it's like a bleeding personality coming out from the figurines.

509
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:29,690
So if the client likes his figurines and if the client likes his taste of the figurines,

510
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:42,250
then it will be good for him as an artist because no one else can replicate his kind of taste

511
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,690
with the same characters or the same illustration he's given.

512
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,330
Right, good secret there.

513
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,370
Amas Roussel, Pixelogic.

514
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,250
Go ahead, take it away.

515
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:51,850
He's got a question.

516
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,450
Is this a question?

517
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:58,450
No, in fact, it's not my question, but online a lot of people are wondering who dance

518
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:04,810
are such models, the polygon count, because it looks very, let's say, very simple surfaces,

519
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,890
but you have some very controlled curves.

520
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,410
Then you need to have a lot of polygons while it looks simple.

521
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,910
Then how many polygons do you have on such models?

522
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,750
And how does it manage also this polygon count while it's working?

523
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,390
Male Speaker 2

524
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:21,350
No affecting companies.

525
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,030
Well,甜 Эgitter.

526
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,270
What is it on?

527
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:36,930
That's what I am doing.

528
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:38,110
Maybe there are some points of service.

529
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,430
So is that the one sub tool or global?

530
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,030
No, not every single part of it.

531
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,310
I'm just going to have a drawing.

532
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:48,610
Do you think it's a legend of what I'm trying to contribute to that?

533
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:48,730
And this thing is the one sub tool or global.

534
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,270
This has 10 million polygons for the back of the head.

535
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,330
So he doesn't really look at the polycount itself.

536
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,930
You can see it in the UI, you can't find the polycounts.

537
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:36,690
So yeah, he was talking about 20 million polygons.

538
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,030
So it's 20 million?

539
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,710
20 million polygons for the total.

540
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,910
So he will be ending up likely that kind of amount.

541
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,330
That's not so crazy.

542
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,550
No, it's reasonable.

543
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:52,910
Hey, so this book that's sitting here on top of the desk, people inquiring minds want to know,

544
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,210
is this book available in the United States?

545
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:55,790
Yeah.

546
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,010
Yeah, of course, and through Amazon, of course, right?

547
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:58,490
Yeah.

548
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:03,770
You can search his name and just type book and this will come up.

549
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,930
Okay, we got one in the front row.

550
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,270
Go ahead.

551
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:09,890
Joey here.

552
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:17,490
When you're reviewing the concept art of the illustration for reference, what part of that helps the most?

553
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:38,990
So is that a reference which the client asks you or the additional references you add to them?

554
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,770
Yeah.

555
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,790
How about the reference is applied?

556
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:42,470
Yeah.

557
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,550
Like an illustration or something like that.

558
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,370
Clientが送ってくる人とかそういう感じの資料ですか?

559
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,810
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

560
00:57:52,810 --> 00:58:21,770
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

561
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:50,770
So, a couple of things, one is the pose, and one is the scale of the characters, like body parts, like if they...

562
00:58:50,770 --> 00:59:09,650
Usually, Japanese artists like considers the head is the one scale, so usually one scale is equivalent of the arm itself, and so he is looking at these kind of like scales and what kind of ratio this kind of like part has.

563
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:21,750
So, he will look at the pose, how is the model looking like, and then the scale differences of the parts.

564
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,710
And he will use those kind of information from the reference.

565
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,670
Way in the back here. Let's hear it.

566
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:42,930
I was interested in understanding if he is responsible for the parting of the model for the production, or is that handed off to someone else on his team?

567
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,130
So, he does do the separation himself.

568
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:14,490
So, since this is a team effort, like sometimes he's really, really busy with the other subject or really tight, have a tight schedule, he will hand it off to the other teams or the other workers he has.

569
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,830
So, yeah, in some cases, it happens.

570
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,090
Okay, cool. Got another one back here. Let's hear it.

571
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:33,710
When you were first starting out 3D sculpting, did you have your own illustrations that you were drawing based off of, or did you just choose your most favorite drawings online and start sculpting from there?

572
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,230
3Dの造形を始めた時に自分の描いたイラストを元にしたのか、それとも他の作品のイラストを元にして作ったのか。自分が3D始めた時から他の人のイラストを元に作ってます。

573
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:19,630
So, from the start, when he started doing some 3D sculpting, he started off by using other people's character designs.

574
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:33,830
And he, because one of the reasons why he does this is that he didn't have the good figurine which he was looking for, for his favorite characters.

575
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,170
So, that's why he started making the figurines himself.

576
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,750
Okay, put your hands together.

577
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,750
Akeoru Sakaki, as the smoke rises and fills the room.

578
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,330
Oh yeah, thanks a million.

579
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,710
That was one heck of a presentation, man.

580
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,250
Really appreciate it.

581
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,950
Okay, and this presentation was actually brought to you by...

582
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:56,530
Mikaki.

583
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,430
Did I say that right?

584
01:01:58,210 --> 01:01:58,730
Say it again?

585
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,050
Mimaki.

586
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,410
I've been trying to say that right all day.

587
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:01,990
Mimaki.

588
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:02,530
Mimaki.

589
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:03,290
Not Takate.

590
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,210
Mimaki.

591
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,390
This is where my head's at.

592
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,770
It's almost party time, people.

593
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,590
Okay, so, we've got some giveaways happening now.

594
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,410
Live from the Nomen School of Visual Effects here inside the green screen hanger.

595
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,650
The same great taste, the same great place.

596
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,690
I'm Louis Tucci, your host for the Zebra Summit 2019.

597
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,950
I hope you're enjoying yourselves at home, tapping away on the keyboard.

598
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,530
It's really great.

599
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,530
Completely appreciate the support.

600
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,190
Here inside the house.

601
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,270
One more time, put it together.

602
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,470
Saturday.

603
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,350
If not now, then when?

604
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,850
If not now, then when?

605
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,390
Thank you.

606
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,030
Thank you.

607
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,990
Okay, they wanted to get my voice a little more clear inside the building here.

608
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:35,690
The house speakers.

609
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,990
Can you guys hear me okay?

610
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:37,450
They're gonna do...

611
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,650
What's all this about?

612
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,790
He's signing the thing.

613
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,610
And a hush comes over the...

614
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,970
We have an extra on-site giveaway happening here.

615
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:45,870
He is signing.

616
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,110
Can you dig...

617
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:47,950
Put your hands together.

618
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,430
Somebody's gonna walk away with the hardware.

619
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,150
Wow.

620
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,110
And the book too.

621
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:53,610
Here we go.

622
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,330
They're hiding the book.

623
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:55,290
Okay.

624
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,290
Yeah, we have extra...

625
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,070
Can you guys hear me?

626
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:58,810
Oh yeah.

627
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,350
Okay, I have an extra giveaway for you guys here.

628
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,850
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

629
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,970
This is an extra prize.

630
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:05,450
This is...

631
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,450
So you don't have to choose the number.

632
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,870
We've already chosen for you.

633
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:09,930
Okay, are you ready?

634
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,090
Looking for 699-084.

635
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:14,770
Come on.

636
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:15,990
Come on down!

637
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:18,350
084.

638
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,130
Tomas, you're not eligible.

639
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,730
Tomas, you are ineligible is the term for that.

640
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,650
You are ineligible, sir.

641
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,950
I don't know how you say that in French, but it's fancy for not available.

642
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:24,610
You can't do it.

643
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,090
699-084.

644
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:26,470
Come on down.

645
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,310
Wow, you did it.

646
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,170
Nice jacket.

647
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:29,150
Look at this.

648
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,350
What?

649
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,190
Michelle, what's happening?

650
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:30,970
Hold on a second.

651
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:31,570
You're standing in the middle.

652
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,210
Hi.

653
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:32,970
Hi.

654
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,550
What's your name?

655
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,070
Michelle.

656
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:34,790
Hi, Michelle.

657
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:35,250
Hi.

658
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,710
Did you enjoy Kyler Sakaki's presentation?

659
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:39,470
Yes.

660
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,530
Well, good news.

661
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,470
Suddenly she's feeding the heat from the lamps.

662
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:48,370
You have won a figure sculpted by Sakaki Sand.

663
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,370
This is Bismarck.

664
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:50,390
Yeah.

665
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,270
Put your hands together.

666
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:52,350
From Good Smile.

667
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:52,950
Look at that.

668
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,690
He's giving it to you personally for Pete's sake.

669
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:55,230
Oh my goodness.

670
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:55,630
And he signed it for you.

671
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,670
Get the photo op in here.

672
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:58,910
Oh my goodness.

673
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,330
A grand origato here.

674
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:01,890
Okay.

675
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:02,530
Amazing.

676
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:03,510
Thanks, Michelle.

677
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:03,890
Enjoy.

678
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:04,450
Thank you.

679
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,010
Thank you.

680
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:05,110
Thank you.

681
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:05,150
Thank you.
