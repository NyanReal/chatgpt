1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:08,370
In the last video, we imported all the assets for email and then enabled all the necessary plugins.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,490
Let's go ahead and start setting up our muscle simulation.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,690
First, let me create a folder called FleshAssets.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,830
And in here, let's create our first FleshAsset.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,830
In this one, I'm going to generate a tetraketral mesh for the muscles.

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,250
So let's call this Fitmesh Muscle FleshAsset.

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,190
Double click that and then say create new data flow.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,430
Click save.

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,410
Now we created a blank data flow graph.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,370
Inside the data flow graph, this is where we'll be setting up our muscle simulation.

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,490
Let's go ahead and save this.

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,210
And then the first thing we're going to do is...

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,890
Let's right click and then type skeletal mesh to bring in our skeletal mesh of the skeleton.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,370
So let's type skeleton here and then find our skeleton.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,030
From here, let's convert it to a collection by calling skeletal mesh to collection.

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,030
Once we do that, now you should see the geometries.

17
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,390
And then also the attributes here in the collection spreadsheet.

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,350
To drive the simulation, we're only going to need the transform from this skeleton.

19
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,290
Because like I said before, we're going to need the animated skeleton to drive the muscles and then the fat.

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,330
And eventually transfer deformation onto the skin.

21
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,930
So skeleton transform is all we're going to need.

22
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,270
Let's make sure we click this transforms only button.

23
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,390
Now we should not see the geometry anymore because now it's only the skeleton transform.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:05,470
Because we're creating a tetrahedral mesh on the muscles, let's bring in the muscle geometry.

25
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,850
Again, the skeletal mesh, but this time it's going to be the muscles.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,660
Here we go.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,710
Now, same thing, let's convert it to a skeleton.

28
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,670
Sorry, a skeletal mesh collection.

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,390
Now you should see the muscles.

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,490
From this point, create a node called create tetrahedron.

31
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,510
And let's modify the parameter a little bit before we plug everything in.

32
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,710
For this one, let's use tetwild to generate a high-resolution tetrahedral mesh.

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,970
And let's make sure we have this coarsen button on.

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,990
Because as an initial test, we want to reduce the resolution of the tetrahedron mesh.

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,470
We can always change this later and go back here and modify the settings.

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,630
But at this point, let's plug in the collection here.

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,470
Let's give it the transforms, also the source geometry.

38
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,590
We're going to use the muscles as the source geometry.

39
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,950
So once that's connected, it should take a little bit of time to generate the tetrahedral mesh.

40
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,790
Again, it should have the transforms here.

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,570
And then generate a volumetric mesh from this surface mesh here.

42
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,730
Remember, the muscles are only a surface mesh.

43
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Now that's done.

44
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,070
You should be able to see the tetrahedral mesh.

45
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,170
This is actually a volumetric mesh.

46
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,590
Great.

47
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,270
We can also transfer the colors from the skeletal mesh to the tetrahedral mesh.

48
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,750
Let's go ahead and do that by calling transfer vertex attribute.

49
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,910
From here, the attribute we want to transfer would be color.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,300
And from collection, let's do the skeletal mesh collection.

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,480
You see, once that's connected, we have all the colors transferred to the tetrahedral mesh.

52
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,620
Let's go ahead and save this into a terminal.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Flash asset terminal.

54
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,950
Now, we save this.

55
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,610
Now, everything inside the collection is saved into our flash asset that we can use.

56
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:58,430
We press F here, and now you should be able to see the saved geometry.

57
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,050
Alright, so in the next video, we'll start using this tetrahedral mesh and start simulating things.

58
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,330
That's true.

59
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:08,850
And then we tap into the spark.

60
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,650
First we'll come from the Archdiocesanh
