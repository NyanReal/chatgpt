1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
And then assign an attribute. Let's call this the inner surface.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,840
And then let's transfer this to the fat layer tetrahedral mesh.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:19,670
Grab this. Grab a transfer attribute, vertex attribute node.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,350
And then connect the collection here.

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,910
In this case, it doesn't matter whether it's a global transfer or a parallel transfer,

6
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,450
because we only have one geometry.

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,650
Let's go ahead and see the transfer results.

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,910
You can see now the inside is white,

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,890
because it's got the attribute transferred to it.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,950
That's good.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,830
And then make sure we replace this collection with the transfer collection

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,330
that contains the attribute.

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,870
After appending it,

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,870
Now, if we go to vertices,

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,050
we should be able to see the attribute.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,330
Call it inner surface here.

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,010
All right.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,310
Next step is extracting the vertex selection from this attribute.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,330
So we've done similar things.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,670
Let's go ahead and get a collection.

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,170
Select by attribute node.

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,170
And plug in the attribute key here.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,220
Okay.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,880
And again, for the threshold,

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,620
let's make sure it's greater than 0.5.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,390
Now this gives us a vertex selection.

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,590
And once we plug in the vertex selection here,

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,850
it's only going to bind spring constraints between the inner surface of the fat

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,570
into whatever is close to the vertices,

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,110
to the selected vertices.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,990
Let's go ahead and connect that.

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,870
And the position target stiffness,

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,690
let's set that to one for now.

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,470
But radius, let's see 0.5.

35
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,010
It's the initial try.

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,630
At this point, we can also visualize

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,780
these little red dots.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,120
They're pretty short spring constraints.

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,120
Although it looks like a dot that's a line connecting.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,220
Two points.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,760
Or two set of vertices.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,860
It's a vertex triangle spring constraint.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,500
Alright.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,200
Let's use this and see what happens in the simulation.

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,010
Let's go ahead and connect this to terminal.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,910
Now you can see we have the whole thing here in the simulation viewport.

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,660
Check our solver settings.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,710
Okay.

49
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,930
And create another chaos cache collection.

50
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,630
Let's call this one the fat.

51
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,870
Cash collection.

52
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,390
Alright.

53
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,790
Let's start running this and see what happens.

54
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,730
Save this.

55
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,550
And start the simulation.

56
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,230
Alright.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,370
We just got back from our simulation results.

58
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,490
As you can see,

59
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,770
the muscle is bulging.

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,350
That's because we didn't change our muscle parameter here.

61
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,990
So let's go ahead and change that.

62
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,390
Over here.

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,470
Make sure we're using...

64
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,870
To use the global parameters.

65
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,350
Change the contract volume to two.

66
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,870
To see some extra volume.

67
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,770
And you also see some penetration between muscles and the fat layer.

68
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:33,190
And that's because the muscle is going through extreme deformation.

69
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,570
Or volume increase.

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,510
And also because of the spring stiffness.

71
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,210
So let's go ahead and change the stiffness from one to ten.

72
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,390
Let's see if that helps.

73
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,950
Now let's run again.

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,120
Now let's take a look at the simulation results.

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,180
Let's find a better angle.

76
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,600
And you can see the biceps start to bulge.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,140
The arm comes up and doing biceps curl.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,860
And the fat layer is driven by the muscle deformation underneath it.

79
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,520
That's good.

80
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,400
And then in the next video, we'll start generating geometry cache from this chaos cache.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,500
And then terrain.

82
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,440
And I'm a deformer with the geometry cache.
