Hello, everybody. My name is Yushan Han. I'm a physics engineer at Epic Games.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,720
In the Witcher 4 Unreal Engine tech demo, we brought series hordes to life using Chaos Flesh system.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,500
And I'm excited to show you how to do that using our character email as an example.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,280
First, make sure you download the zip file from the web page and unzip it under the content directory.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,460
Now, let's make sure you have all the plugins enabled.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,220
First, make sure you have Chaos Flesh enabled.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,160
We're also going to need ML deformers.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,260
So make sure you have ML deformer framework and also ML deformer neural morph model enabled.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,980
Once you have all three of them enabled, make sure you restart the editor so that they're in effect.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,040
Now, let's take a look at the assets we're going to use for our character email here.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,820
Let's go into meshes.

12
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,440
First, we're going to see the skin of email.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:15,270
We also have muscles, skeleton, also the fat layer.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,220
It's a closed fat layer.

15
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,090
The idea is that we're going to use the animated skeleton to drive the muscles and also the fat.

16
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:39,030
And eventually transfer the deformations onto the skin so that we can train a multi-former to learn realistic deformations on the skin.

17
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,870
We're going to use the animations to drive the simulation.

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,270
First, we have this bicep curl animation.

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,740
We also have a range of motion for some general movements of the character.

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,460
In the next video, we'll start setting up muscle simulation on our character email.

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,840
And we'll see here on the next video.
