1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:12,170
And now we want to create a new multi-former. Let's go ahead and do that.

2
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:27,300
This time let's call this animation curve and multi-former. Awesome.

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,240
Save this and open this one. Assign sculptal mesh to be the skin.

4
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:43,250
And then animation sequence. Be the training data one and also the geometry cache.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:53,060
Great. Now here it says needs inputs. Now remember this time we need to give the curves as inputs.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,680
So if you add all of the curves, they both should show up over here.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:15,660
It's 100 iterations. Over here, if you use the local mode, I think that's not working for the current 5.6 release.

8
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,300
This is something we just fixed.

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,160
For 5.7 exactly, you should see the error message.

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,720
So make sure you change that from local to global.

11
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,300
And then train model again.

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,980
You see the loss is going down. You can use more iterations if you want to, but for demonstration purpose.

13
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,010
Now you should also see an error message saying train neural network is incompatible with selected sculptal mesh.

14
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,890
If you open up the output log, it will show you that the bicep curve or the lower pec curve is missing.

15
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,870
So let's go ahead and go to the sculptal mesh.

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,070
Then find the skeleton.

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,670
That is right here.

18
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,250
And let's copy these curves.

19
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,590
Then we can paste it here.

20
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,830
Let's go.

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,290
We save this.

22
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,350
Go back to the former.

23
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,850
Close this one.

24
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:27,930
Train.

25
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,750
And then train again.

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,530
Now you should see that error message should be gone.

27
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:47,670
That's because that multi-former right now only supports curves on the skeleton asset instead of the skeletal mesh asset.

28
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,030
I believe they're fixing this in the very next release.

29
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,370
So now we can start validating our training.

30
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,450
Let's go into testing.

31
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,570
Then again, set the test animation to be exactly the same as training animation.

32
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,310
Just to see if the network fits.

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,150
And we can turn on show heat map.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,950
Now you can see where the delta is being applied.

35
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,190
So again, from 0 to 20, it's a bicep contraction.

36
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,510
And then 20 to 40, it's a lower pec contraction.

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,590
Which means our network is fitting pretty good.

38
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,870
Now let's use this curve driven a multi-former in blueprint example.

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,570
Let's go back to the main level.

40
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,790
And let's create a new level.

41
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,710
Okay.

42
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,350
And then let's drag out our sculptor mesh, which is the skin.

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,730
That's right here.

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,660
Now let's make a blueprint out of this.

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,960
So we can do this by convert selection to a blueprint class.

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
That's good.

47
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,470
Now there's our blueprint.

48
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,330
And over here, we can add a multi-former component.

49
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,610
And what we can do is we can assign our multi-former asset.

50
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,250
This is assigned to be the one that we just created.

51
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,130
Okay.

52
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,990
And over here, the sculptor mesh component.

53
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,850
Let's use animation asset because eventually we're going to drive this using animation.

54
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,450
So let's compile this for now.

55
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:53,870
But over here, the eventual animation that we'll use will be a copy of the bicep curl animation.

56
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,250
So let's duplicate that.

57
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,670
We're going to call this slip weights, but with activation.

58
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,660
Okay, let's save this.

59
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:18,920
And if we go back to the blueprint, we can assign this animation data.

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,820
You can see now it starts to play.

61
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,980
Make sure we compile this.

62
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,320
Save this.

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,340
Let's start adding some curves to the animation to drive independent muscle activation.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,940
Go to our animation over here, and then add curve here.

65
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,200
Let's find our bicep.

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,020
And also the lower pec curve.

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
There we go.

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,140
Add them too.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,300
We can open them up in the curve editor.

70
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,020
And let's start by adding a pulse to the bicep.

71
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,170
Add some keys to it.

72
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,790
Another one.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,340
So something in the middle.

74
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,200
Now let's make it from 0 to 1.

75
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,540
Approximately.

76
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Now we can save this.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,260
If we go back to our blueprint and wait for the start of the animation.

79
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,080
There we go.

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,940
We should see a quick contraction of the bicep.

81
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,280
And that's from the animation curve, actually.

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,380
Okay.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
So let's actually refine that a little bit.

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Back to our animation.

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
Then start making some meaningful adjustments.

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
Okay.

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,220
Okay.

88
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,600
The idea is that when we have the animation over here.

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,610
Say when arm starts to contract.

90
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,290
Right there.

91
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,670
We want some lower pec contraction.

92
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,710
Okay.

93
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,230
So let's mark this as the starting point.

94
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,390
Add a key to it.

95
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,580
And let's mark here to be...

96
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,560
Or over here to be the end of it.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,520
Then let's add a pulse.

98
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,100
Alright.

99
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,520
Let's also add some bicep contraction there.

100
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,600
So let's say we start from here.

101
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,640
The bicep.

102
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,180
Let's delete the current ones first.

103
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,080
Say we're starting from here.

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,360
Add key.

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,420
And then about here is the peak.

106
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,740
And here is the end.

107
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,220
Again, from 0 to 1 to 0.

108
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
So look at that.

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,260
Now we have...

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,540
Modify two curves.

111
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,240
So that they should behave differently

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,300
in the very first bicep curl.

113
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,260
So let's save this.

114
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,580
And go back to the blueprint.

115
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,180
Try to see the difference.

116
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,380
Boom.

117
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,860
It starts.

118
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
Zoom in a little bit.

119
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,580
Wait for it to restart.

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,280
There you can see the lower pec is contracting.

121
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,420
Let's focus on the bicep this time.

122
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,790
Start over.

123
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,190
There.

124
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,690
See now we have a bicep contraction right there.

125
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,070
And that's how I want to show you

126
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,010
how to control muscle activation independently.

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,890
Besides the pose-driven ML deformer.

128
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,890
And I hope you enjoy this series.
